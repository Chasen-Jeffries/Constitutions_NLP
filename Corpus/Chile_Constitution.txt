In the absence of an agreement, the compensation shall be paid in cash.

The material possession of the expropriated property shall take place upon payment of total compensation, which, in the absence of an agreement, shall be provisionally determined by experts in the manner provided by the law.

In any case, the said grounds and its effects must be established at the time of granting the concession.

It will be the sole jurisdiction of the ordinary courts to declare the extinction of such concessions. Disputes concerning the expiration or termination of ownership of the concession will be settled by them; and, in the case of expiration, the affected party may request from the judiciary the declaration of the subsistence of its right.

The ownership of the holder over its mining concession is protected by the constitutional guarantee referred to in this number.

The exploration, exploitation or development of deposits containing substances not susceptible to concession, may be implemented directly by the State or its enterprises, or by means of administrative concessions or special operation contracts of operation, with the requirements and under the conditions that the President of the Republic determines, in each case, by a supreme decree. This rule also applies to deposits of any kinds existing in sea waters subject to national jurisdiction and those located, in whole or in part, in zones that, according to law, are of importance to national security. The President of the Republic may, at any time, without express cause and with the compensation that is due, terminate the administrative concessions or contracts of operation in relation to the exploitation in zones declared of importance to national security.

Likewise, the remedy of protection will also proceed in the case of number 8 of article 19, when the right to live in a pollution-free environment is affected by an unlawful act or omission attributable to a specific authority or person.

ARTICLE 21
Every individual who should be found arrested, detained or imprisoned in violation of what is established in the Constitution or the laws, may concur personally, or through anyone on his behalf, to the court established by the law, so that it orders that the legal formalities be complied with an that it immediately adopts the providences it deems necessary to restore the rule of law and ensure due protection of the affected party.

This court may require the individual to be brought into its presence and its decree will be precisely obeyed by all of those responsible of prisons or detention centers. Instructed of the facts, it will decree his immediate release or will repair the legal defects or will put the individual at the disposition of the competent judge, proceeding briefly and summarily, and correcting by itself such defects or reporting them to whom it corresponds to correct them.

The same remedy, and in equal form, may be filed on behalf of any person who illegally suffers any deprivation, disruption or threat to his right to personal freedom and individual security. The respective court will dictate in those cases the measures outlined in the preceding paragraphs that it deems necessary to restore the rule of law and to ensure due protection of the affected party.

The representative or senator that has gravely infringed the rules on transparency limits and control of electoral expenditure will cease in his position from the date that the Election Qualifying Court declares it through final sentence, at the request of the Directive Council of the Electoral Service.

This decision may be appealed to the Supreme Court.

In case of a representative or senator being arrested for a flagrant crime, he will be put immediately at the disposition of the respective Court of Appeals, with corresponding summary information. The Court will then proceed, in accordance with the provisions of the preceding paragraph.

From the moment that it is declared, through a final resolution, that there is cause for legal proceeding, the imputed representative or senator becomes suspended from his office and subject to the competent judge.

The statutory laws to which the Constitution confers the character of constitutional organic laws will require, for their approval, amendment or repeal, of the four sevenths of the Representative and senators in exercise.

The statutory laws of qualified quorum will be established, amended or repealed by the absolute majority of the Representative and senators in exercise.

The rest of the statutory laws require the majority of the present members of each House, or the majorities that are applicable in conformity to article 68 et seq.

ARTICLE 67

The National Congress may not increase nor decrease the estimation of the revenue; it can only reduce the expenses contained in the Budget Law bill, except those established by permanent law.

The estimation of the returns of the resources stated in the Budget Law and of the new ones that are established by any other bill, will correspond exclusively to the President, having been previously informed by the respective technical organisms.

The Congress shall not be able to approve any new expenditure from the funds of the Nation without indicating, at the same time, the sources of resources necessary to meet that expense.

If the source of resources granted by Congress were to be insufficient to fund any new expense that is approved, the President of the Republic, at the time of promulgating the law, after a favorable report from the service or institution through which the new income is collected, endorsed by the Office of the Comptroller General of the Republic, shall reduce all expenses proportionally, whatever their nature.

ARTICLE 68
The bill which is rejected in general in the House of origin cannot be renewed until after a year. However, the President of the Republic, in case of a bill of his own initiative, may ask that the message be sent to the other House and, if the latter approves it in general by two-thirds of its present members, it will return to the House of origin and will only be considered rejected if this House rejects it by the vote of two-thirds of its present members.

ARTICLE 69
Any bill may be subject to additions or corrections in its proceedings, both in the House of Representatives as in the Senate; but in no case the ones that do not have a direct relation with the central or fundamental ideas of the bill will be admitted.

Once a bill is approved in the House of origin, it will immediately pass to the other for its discussion.

ARTICLE 70
The bill which is rejected in its entirety by the reviewing House will be considered by a joint commission of equal numbers of Representative and senators, which will propose the form and manner of resolving the difficulties. The bill of the joint commission will return to the House of origin and, to be approved in this as in the reviewing House, it will require the majority of the members present in each one of them. If the mixed commission does not reach an agreement, or if the House of origin rejects the bill of this commission, the President of the Republic may require that that House pronounces itself on whether it insists by two-thirds of its members present in the bill approved in the first procedure. If the insistence is agreed, the bill will pass for the second time to the House that rejected it, and it will be understood that this one rejects it only if two-thirds of its present members concur in it.

ARTICLE 71
The bill that has been subjected to additions or amended by the reviewing House will return to the one of origin, and in this one it will be understood that the additions and amendments are approved with the vote of the majority of the present members.

If the additions or amendments were rejected, a mixed commission will be formed and it will proceed in the same manner indicated in the preceding article. If the mixed commission does not reach an agreement to settle the differences between the Houses, or if any of the Houses reject the proposition of the mixed commission, the President of the Republic may ask to the House of origin to consider again the bill approved in the second stage by the reviewing House. If the House of origin rejected the additions or amendments by two-thirds of its present members, there will be no law in that part or in its entirety; but, if there is a majority for rejection which is less than two-thirds, the bill shall pass to the reviewing House, and it will be understood to be approved by the vote of two-thirds of the members present in the latter.

ARTICLE 74
The President of the Republic may declare the urgency in the dispatch of a bill, in one or all of its stages of processing, and in which case, the respective House shall pronounce itself within a maximum period of thirty days.

CHAPTER VI. JUDICIARY
ARTICLE 76
The power to hear civil and criminal cases, to resolve them and to enforce judgments, is vested exclusively to the courts established by law. Neither the President of the Republic nor the Congress may, in any case, exercise judicial functions, take over pending cases, review the grounds or contents of their decisions or revive closed cases.

Courts may not excuse themselves from exercising their authority if their intervention is requested in a legal manner and in connection with affairs of their jurisdiction, not even in the absence of a law to resolve the dispute or issue submitted to their decision.

To enforce their resolutions, and to practice or have practiced the acts of instruction established by law, the ordinary and special courts of justice that make up the Judiciary, may issue direct orders to the public force or exercise the conductive means of action of which they dispose. Other courts will do so in the manner established by law.

The requested authority shall comply without further delay the judicial mandate and will not qualify the grounds or opportunity, nor the justice or legality of the resolution that is trying to be executed.

ARTICLE 77
A constitutional organic law will determine the organization and powers of the courts that may be necessary for the prompt and complete administration of justice throughout the territory of the Republic. The same law shall establish the qualities that the judges must respectively have and the number of years that the persons appointed as Court Justices or career judges must have practiced the profession of lawyer.

The constitutional organic law on the organization and powers of the courts may be amended after hearing the Supreme Court, in accordance with the provisions of the respective constitutional organic law.

The Supreme Court must deliver this opinion within thirty days from the reception of the official letter in which the relevant opinion is requested.

However, if the President of the Republic would have made present the urgency of the consulted bill, this fact shall be communicated to the Court.

In that case, the Court must deliver its opinion within the period of time which the respective urgency specifies.

If the Supreme Court does not deliver its opinion within the aforementioned deadlines, the procedure will be concluded.

The constitutional organic law on the organization and powers of the courts, as well as the procedural laws that regulate a system of prosecution, may set different dates for their entry into force in various regions of the country. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the period for entry into force of these laws across the country may not exceed four years.

ARTICLE 78
As for the appointment of judges, the law shall meet the following general precepts.

The Supreme Court shall consist of twenty-one justices.

Justices and judicial prosecutors of the Supreme Court shall be appointed by the President of the Republic -choosing from a list of five people that, in each case, will be proposed by the same Court- with the agreement of the Senate. The latter will adopt the respective agreements by two-thirds of its members in office, at a session called for that purpose. If the Senate does not approve the proposal of the President of the Republic, the Supreme Court must complete the list proposing a new person in substitution of the rejected one, repeating the process until a proposal is approved.

Five of the members of the Supreme Court shall be lawyers that are strangers to the administration of justice, they must have had the law degree for at least fifteen years, must have excelled in professional or academic activity and must fulfill the other requirements that the respective constitutional organic law stipulates.

The Supreme Court, in the case of filling a position that corresponds to a member that comes from the Judiciary, will form the list exclusively with members of the latter, and the most senior Justice of the Court of Appeals that appears in the merits list shall occupy a place in it. The other four places will be filled in reason to the merits of the candidates. In the case of filling a position corresponding to lawyers that are strangers to the administration of justice, the list will be formed exclusively, with a previous public contest of antecedents, with lawyers who meet the qualifications set out in paragraph four.

The Justices and judicial prosecutors of the Courts of Appeals shall be designated by the President of the Republic, from a list of three candidates proposed by the Supreme Court.

Career judges shall be designated by the President of the Republic, from a list of three candidates proposed by the Court of Appeals of the respective jurisdiction.

The most senior career judge, in civil or criminal law, with a seat of Court or the most senior career judge, in civil or criminal law, of the position which is immediately inferior to that which is to be filled and that figures in the merits list and expresses his interest in the position, will occupy a place in the corresponding three-candidate list. The other two places will be filled in accordance with the merits of the candidates.

The Supreme Court and the Courts of Appeals, when appropriate, will form lists of five or three candidates in a plenum specially convened for that purpose, in a single vote, in which each of its members will have the right to vote for three or two people respectively. The ones that obtain the five or three first majorities, correspondingly, will result elected. A tie will be decided by drawing lots.

However, in the case of the appointment of substitute Court Justices, the designation can be made by the Supreme Court and, in the case of judges, by the respective Court of Appeals. These designations may not last more than sixty days and will not be extendible. Should the aforementioned superior courts not exercise this power, or in the case that the substitution period has expired, the filling of the vacant positions will be done in the ordinary manner indicated above.

ARTICLE 79
Judges are personally liable for crimes of bribery, failure to observe substantial matters of the laws that govern the procedure, denial and distorted administration of justice and, generally, any prevarication incurred in the performance of their duties.

In the case of members of the Supreme Court, the law shall determine the cases and how to enforce this liability.

ARTICLE 80
Judges shall hold office during their good behavior; but the inferior judges will perform their respective judicature for the time determined by the law.

Nevertheless, the judges cease to hold office once they reach 75 years of age; or by resignation or legal supervening incapacity or in the case they are deposed from their positions by a legally sentenced cause. The norm regarding age does not apply in respect to the President of the Supreme Court, who will remain in office until the end of his term.

In any case, the Supreme Court upon request of the President of the Republic, at the request of an interested party, or ex officio, may declare that the judges have not had good behavior and, after a report of the accused and of the respective Court of Appeals, if necessary, may agree to their removal by the majority of the total of its components. These agreements shall be communicated to the President of the Republic for their compliance.

The Supreme Court, in plenum specially convened for that purpose, and by the absolute majority of its active members, may authorize or order, rightly, the transfer of judges and other officials and employees of the Judiciary to another position of the same category.

ARTICLE 81
The magistrates of the superior courts of justice, the judicial prosecutors and the career judges that make up the Judiciary, shall not be arrested whiteout an order of the competent court, except in the cases of a flagrant crime or a simple offense, and only to be put immediately under the disposition of the court that must hear the case in accordance with the law.

ARTICLE 82
The Supreme Court holds the directive, correctional and economic supervision of all courts of this nation. The Constitutional Court, the Election Qualifying Court and regional electoral courts are excepted from this rule.

The superior courts of justice, in exercise of their disciplinary powers, can only invalidate jurisdictional decisions in the cases and manner prescribed by the respective constitutional organic law.

CHAPTER VII. PUBLIC MINISTRY
ARTICLE 83
An autonomous, hierarchical body, named Public Ministry, will exclusively direct the investigation of facts that constitute a crime; those that determine the punishable participation and those that prove the innocence of the accused and, when appropriate, will exercise the public penal action in the manner provided by the law. Likewise, it will adopt measures to protect victims and witnesses. In no event it shall exercise jurisdictional functions.

The victim of a crime and other persons established by the law may also exercise the penal action.

The Public Ministry may issue direct orders to the Forces of Order and Security during the investigation. However, the actions that deprives the accused or third parties of the exercise of the rights that this Constitution guarantees, or that restrict or perturb them, will require a prior judicial approval. The requested authority shall comply without further delay these orders and cannot qualify their grounds, opportunity, justice or legality, except in the case of requiring the exhibition of the prior judicial authorization, when it corresponds.

The exercise of the public penal action, and the direction of the investigations of the events that constitute a crime, that determine the punishable participation and that prove the innocence of the accused in the cases that are known by military courts, as well as the adoption of measures to protect victims and witnesses of those events, will correspond, in accordance with the rules of the Code of Military Justice and the respective laws, to the bodies and persons that that Code and those laws establish.

ARTICLE 84
A constitutional organic law will set forth the organization and powers of the Public Ministry, will determine the qualifications and requirements that prosecutors must have and comply with in order to be appointed and the grounds for dismissal of the adjunct prosecutors, regarding what is not contemplated in the Constitution. The persons that are designated as prosecutors shall not have any impediment that disables them from holding the office of judge. Regional and adjunct prosecutors will cease in their position once they reach 75 years of age.

The constitutional organic law will establish the degree of independence and autonomy and the responsibility that prosecutors will have in the direction of the investigation and in the exercise of the public penal action, in the cases in which they are in charge.

ARTICLE 85
The National Prosecutor shall be appointed by the President of the Republic, from a five-candidate list proposed by the Supreme Court and with the agreement of two-thirds of the members in office of the Senate, in a session specially convened for that purpose. If the Senate does not approve the proposal of the President of the Republic, the Supreme Court will have to complete the five-candidate list by proposing a new person to replace the rejected, repeating the process until an appointment is approved.

The National Prosecutor must have held the degree of lawyer for at least ten years, must have become forty years of age and possess the other qualifications which are necessary to be a citizen with the right to vote; he will last eight years in the exercise of his functions and may not be designated for the following period.

What is established in the second paragraph of article 80 with regard to age limit is applicable to the National Prosecutor.

ARTICLE 86
There will be a Regional Prosecutor in each of the regions in which the country is administratively divided, unless the population or geographical extension of the region makes it necessary for more than one to be appointed.

Regional prosecutors shall be appointed by the National Prosecutor, from a three-candidate list proposed by the Court of Appeals of the respective region. Should the region have more than one Court of Appeals, the three-candidate list will be formed by a joint plenum of all of them, specially convened for this reason by the President of the oldest created Court.

Regional prosecutors must have held the degree of lawyer for at least five years, must have become thirty years of age and posses the other qualifications which are necessary to be a citizen with the right to vote; they will last eight years in the exercise of their functions and may not be designated as regional prosecutors for the following period, which does not prevent them from being appointed in another position of the Public Ministry.

ARTICLE 87
The Supreme Court and the Courts of Appeals, in such case, will call for a public contest of antecedents for the integration of both five-candidate and three-candidate’s lists, which will be agreed upon by the absolute majority of their active members, in a plenum specially convened for that purpose. Both five-candidates and three-candidate’s lists cannot be integrated by active or pensioned members of the Judiciary.

The five- and three-candidate lists will be formed in a single vote in which each member of the plenum will have the right to vote for the three or two people, respectively. The ones obtaining the five or three first majorities, correspondingly, will be elected. If there is a tie, it will be resolved by drawing lots.

ARTICLE 88
There will be adjunct prosecutors who will be designated by the National Prosecutor, from a three-candidate list proposed by the respective regional prosecutor, which shall be formed following a public contest, in accordance with the constitutional organic law. They must hold the lawyer degree and must possess the other qualifications which are necessary to be a citizen with the right to vote.

ARTICLE 89
The National Prosecutor and regional prosecutors may only be removed by the Supreme Court, at the request of the President of the Republic, the House of Representative, or of ten of its members, for ineligibility, misconduct or gross negligence in the performance of their functions. The Court will hear the case in plenum specially convened for this purpose and, for there to be agreement on the removal, there must be a confirming vote of the majority of its active members.

The municipalities and the National Corporation for Indigenous Development may allocate resources and logistical means to facilitate the dissemination and registration of indigenous voters.

The seventeen seats reserved for indigenous peoples contemplated in this provision shall be determined by the Electoral Service, within the one-hundred and fifty-five seats to be elected by virtue of the electoral districts established in article 141 of this Constitution.

However, only one seat per district may be discounted, and no seat will be discounted with respect to the electoral districts that elect three conventional ones. For this discount, the National Institute of Statistics must deliver to the Electoral Service the information regarding the total number of persons over 18 years of age who declared themselves indigenous in the last Census in each district.

The Electoral Service must determine within a period of five days from the publication of this reform the seats that correspond by virtue of the previous paragraph.

The candidate with the most votes corresponding to the Mapuche people and whose electoral domicile is in the Metropolitan Region of Santiago, or in the regions of Coquimbo, Valparaíso, Liberator General Bernardo O'Higgins or Maule, will be preliminarily elected. Then, the four most voted candidates that correspond to the Mapuche people and that have their electoral domicile in the Ñuble, Biobío or La Araucanía regions will be preliminarily elected. Next, the two most voted candidates corresponding to the Mapuche people and having their electoral domicile in the Los Ríos, Los Lagos or Aysén regions of General Carlos Ibáñez del Campo will be preliminarily elected.

In addition, the two most voted candidates corresponding to the Aymara people will be preliminarily elected.

For the other towns, one or one Conventional Constituent will be preliminarily elected, corresponding to the most voted candidate for each one of them.

Parity between men and women will be guaranteed in the final allocation of seats for conventional constituents representing indigenous peoples, as indicated below:

In the case of the Mapuche people, if once the candidates have been preliminarily assigned, those of one sex outnumber the other by more than one seat, the substitution by the respective alternative equal candidacy will operate as follows: the candidacy of the overrepresented sex with the lowest vote he will yield his seat to his alternative joint candidacy. This process will be repeated as many times as necessary, until neither sex surpasses the other in one seat.

In the case of the Aymara people, if the candidates elected with the first majorities were of the same sex, the least voted candidate of those preliminarily elected will be substituted following the same mechanism indicated in the previous paragraph.

In the case of the other towns, which will each have only one seat, if added to their seats in the final result, gender balance is not achieved, it must be corrected by substituting the least voted candidate (s) of the overrepresented sex by their alternative equal candidacy until gender balance is achieved.

For the purposes of the preceding paragraphs, the least voted candidacy will be understood as the one that is lower in relation to the number of votes obtained and the total number of voters of the corresponding town.

The affiliates will be able to make the request for this withdrawal of funds on a platform with digital, telephone and face-to-face support provided by the pension fund administrators, ensuring an efficient process without delays. The funds that in application of this provision correspond to the affiliate will be automatically transferred to "Account 2" without administration or insurance commission or any cost to him, or to a bank account or financial institutions and compensation funds, as determined the affiliate. Withdrawals made in accordance with this provision will be compatible with direct transfers, benefits, financing alternatives and, in general, the economic measures that the law or regulations establish due to COVID-19. The withdrawal of funds may not be considered for the calculation of the other measures adopted due to the crisis or vice versa. Any person who belongs to said system, including those who are beneficiaries of an old-age, disability or survivorship pension, will be considered affiliated to the private pension system governed by Decree Law No. 3,500, of 1980. The funds accumulated and authorized to be withdrawn will be delivered within a maximum period of fifteen business days, counted from the presentation of the request to the respective pension fund administrator. The implementation of the fund transfer system and other measures that are carried out by virtue of this provision will have no cost for the affiliates. In addition, the pension fund administrators must send to the Superintendency of Pensions, and to the Central Bank when appropriate, any information on compliance with the measures that are carried out as a result of the application of this provision. The observance, supervision and sanction of the obligations of the pension fund administrators contained in this provision will correspond to the competent authority within its legal attributions.

As of the publication in the Official Gazette of this reform and up to the following 365 days, pensioners or their life annuity beneficiaries may, once and voluntarily, advance the payment of their annuities up to an equivalent amount to ten percent of the value corresponding to the technical reserve that the pensioner maintains in the respective insurance company to cover the payment of their pensions, with a maximum limit of one-hundred and fifty development units.

The withdrawal made by pensioners or their beneficiaries who choose to request it, will be charged to the monthly amount of their future life annuities, pro rata, in proportion and in the same percentage as that representing the amount effectively withdrawn.

The rules regarding the intangibility and nature of these resources, the processing of the application, the payment of unpaid alimony pensions and the informing of the corresponding authorities, including the Financial Market Commission, contained in the preceding paragraphs of this provision, will be applicable to requests for advances made by pensioners or their beneficiaries for life annuities. However, the payment of the requested funds will be made to the pensioner or the beneficiaries of it within a maximum period of thirty calendar days, counted from the receipt of the request. The Commission for the Financial Market shall issue the necessary instructions for the application of the preceding paragraphs.
