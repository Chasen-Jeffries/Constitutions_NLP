# 📜 NLP Analysis of Democratic and Competitive Authoritarian Constitutions 🌍

## 🎯 Project Overview
This project delves into the fascinating world of constitutions, employing Natural Language Processing (NLP) to uncover whether the foundational texts of democratic and competitive authoritarian governments speak a different linguistic language. Amidst the global complexity of regimes that blend democratic veneers with authoritarian cores, our mission is to discover unique linguistic markers that could reveal the true nature of a government's regime. Initial tests and explorations have already shown promising results, suggesting that our approach could indeed illuminate the nuanced linguistic distinctions between these types of regimes.

## 📈 Current Situation
- **Objective**: Expand our corpus to a robust collection of 50 documents, aiming to enhance the dataset's breadth and thereby refine our model's predictive prowess.

## ❓ Problem Statement
In the shadow of the Cold War's conclusion, the art of governance has seen a shift with non-democratic entities cloaking their authoritarianism beneath democratic facades. Competitive authoritarian regimes, characterized by their electoral charades yet fundamental democratic deficiencies, have muddied the waters of regime classification. Through the lens of NLP, we venture to uncover if the constitutions of democracies and competitive authoritarianisms narrate different tales. This exploration seeks to harness the power of NLP in forecasting a nation's regime through its constitutional script.

## 🚀 Research Plan

### 📚 Corpus
Our scholarly journey is navigated through a carefully curated dataset of constitutions from ten diverse nations, partitioned equally between democracies (D) and competitive authoritarian (CA) regimes, offering a window into the varied landscapes of global governance.

### 🔍 Analysis
Our investigative lens zooms in at the micro level, dissecting sentence-level constructs, and pans out to a macro view, comparing the democratic and authoritarian tapestries. This bifocal approach integrates linguistic minutiae with overarching narratives, setting the stage for a predictive model that uses linguistic features as clues to a constitution's democratic or authoritarian essence.

### 🛠 NLP Pipeline
1. **Original Corpus**: The starting point of our linguistic expedition.
2. **Data Exploration**: A preliminary sift through our textual treasure.
3. **Cleaning & Preprocessing**: A meticulous process to prepare the text for analysis.
4. **Feature Extraction**: Mining the text for linguistic gems.
5. **Modeling**: Crafting the predictive model.
6. **Evaluation**: Assessing the model's foresight.

## 📊 Evaluation
Given our intimate sample size, we tread carefully with an exploratory analysis, potentially laying the groundwork for larger, more definitive studies. Our evaluative gaze will rest on the model's clarity of vision, its precision, recall, and the narrative it weaves about the accuracy of our linguistic conjectures.
